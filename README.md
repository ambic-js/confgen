ðŸ‘· **confgen** is a scaffolding tool in the genre of create-react-app, with a few notable difference:

1. _It's idempotent_, you can keep running it over time as you need to configure new features or reconfigure old ones.

2. It _doesn't set up a working app_. The point is to automate the repetitive an error prone task of getting all the different libraries working together. In other words: it sets up the files you probably won't touch much. The actual code you work on every day you set up yourself.

You can think of confgen as an alternative to the monorepo strategy: It makes it easier to have different repos for different parts of your stack, because it helps keep a lot of the configuration up-to-date.

## Manual

```
**confgen <builds> <presets>

Examples:
  confgen @app @server @package dist:app:package codegen:app:queries react vitest
  confgen @lib @app @package dist:lib react vitest
  confgen @lib @package dist:lib codegen:lib:schema:resolvers vitest

Options:
  <builds>     Space separated selection of "builds" i.e. folders with code meant to be
               run in a specific environment:

                  @lib â€” code is called via a library interface (either in Node or the browser)
                  @app â€” code that boots in an HTML context in the browser
                  @server â€” code that boots in Node
                  @package â€” code that consumes the build (e.g. dist tests, or an app wrapper)

                These folders (lib/, app/, etc) are the ONLY folders which may be used
                for source code.

  <presets>     Space-separated presets defining which features to be configured. Presets
                may be tied to a specific folder or folders, using the @ symbol, and may
                have a number of colon-separated arguments

                Examples:
                  prettier
                  dist:app:lib
                  codegen:lib:schema:resolvers

                Available presets:

                                                and sets up the Node packages needed inVite
                  prettier                    Code formatting with format-on-save in codespace

```

## Example

Let's say you have a **design system** package, and an **application** package, both of which use React and TypeScript. And let's say you want to enable Eslint. And your team is editing these apps in VScode.

There's a bunch of gotchas associated with that:

1. Your `tsconfig.json` needs to have the `"dom"` lib, otherwise you'll get type errors when trying to reference `document` and other browser globals.
2. You also need to set the `jsx` flag to `"react"` for your TSX files to pass type check.
3. The `@typescript-eslint` plugin needs to be enabled in your `.eslintrc`.
4. And for that to work, the `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` NPM packages need to be installed.
5. `source.fixAll.eslint` needs to be added to your `editor.codeActionsOnSave` in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.
6. And for that to work, you need a `.devcontainer` set up with the `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` extension installed.
7. You probably also want commands to run the linter, autofix, check the types, etc in your `package.json`.

I could go on, but there's a lot to coordinate!

And those are just the common pieces of configuration that you're going to share between your design system and your application.

Let's say you're using Vite to build the **design system** as an NPM package. You'll need a command to generate typings, make sure they're named properly in your `dist/` folder, make sure everything is being exported properly in your `package.json`. Etc, etc.

All of this is the kind of work that **confgen** does for you.

## Who this is _not_ for

Right now, confgen only works with a fairly opinionated set of tools. If you want to use Webpack or Angular, you're out of luck. This tool is really geared towards people who are using:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Apollo
- Codespaces

Although it is still quite useful even if you're just using a subset of those! If you just have an API server written in TypeScript on Vite, it can still do a lot for you.

But if you are trying to coordinate configs across a very different stack than the above, it's probably not going to help much.

## How to use it

It's recommended to add a `confgen` script to your package.json:

```
{
  "scripts: {
    "confgen": "npx confgen@latest codespaces git vite vitest typescript library:VoiceChat prettier eslint"
  }
}
```

Then you can run `yarn confgen` or `npm run confgen` and the relevant configs will be updated. It's important to add `@latest` so you get the most recent updates each time!

### Typical confgens

A Node library (with code generation and tests):

```
confgen @lib @package dist:lib codegen:lib:schema:resolvers vitest
```

A browser library (with a dev server and tests):

```
confgen @lib @app @package dist:lib react vitest
```

An application (with a dev server, an exported app wrapper, and tests):

```
confgen @app @server @package dist:app:package codegen:app:queries react vitest
```

### Running the scripts

Depending on which presets you choose, lots of package.json scripts will be available:

- `yarn build` runs all of the build sub-commands:
  - `yarn build:generate` generates GraphQL code
  - `yarn build:vite` packages the app into `dist/`
  - `yarn build:types` generates typgins in `dist/`
- `yarn start:api` starts an API server if you have one
- `yarn start:dev` or `yarn start:[your folder]` starts the dev server
- `yarn fix` runs all of the fix sub-commands:
  - `yarn fix:lint` fixes all of the Eslint errors that can be auto-fixed
  - `yarn fix:format` runs Prettier
- `yarn check:types` looks for type errors
- `yarn check:lint` looks for lint errors
- `yarn test` runs the tests
  - `yarn test:watch` runs them in watch mode
  - `yarn test -t presets/codegen`, `yarn test -t @build`, etc runs a single test file (top level `describe`)

...and last but not least,

- `yarn all the things!` runs all of the build, fix, check, and test scripts. Good for pre-publish.

If you want an easy way to publish a new version of your NPM package, check out my other package, [bump-n-pub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bump-n-pub). My typical workflow for publishing a package is:

```
yarn confgen
yarn all the things!
npx bump-n-pub minor
```

### Extending it

This package is very new, so it's quite likely you'll want to extend it. The easiest way to do that
would be to fork `confgen` and vendor it in your application:

```
mkdir vendor
cd vendor
git clone https://github.com/erikpukinskis/confgen.git
cd confgen
yarn
yarn run build
```

And then add the local version to your dependencies:

```
{
  dependencies: {
    "confgen": "file:./vendor/confgen"
  }
}
```

Then you can go ahead and modify the presets in `vendor/confgen/lib/presets` to suit your needs. Or
add an entirely new preset by copying one of the scripts in that folder and adding it to
`lib/presets/index.ts`.

Then [submit a pull request](https://github.com/erikpukinskis/confgen/pulls)!

## Running tests

Run the tests:

```
yarn test
```

In watch mode:

```
yarn test:watch
```

Just one test suite:

```
yarn test -t presets/library
```

Just one test:

```
yarn test -t "should not clobber existing build commands"
```

## Foundational Principles

* **Support single purpose repos** â€” This is the bottom line goal of Confgen. It is not meant to work in a monorepo. Although repos often need secondary modes of runningâ€”dev server, documentation server, dist tests, etcâ€”Confgen presumes that each repo has a single primary purpose. It will not configure two substantial bodies of code in a single repo. See Issue #1.

* **Don't clobber the configs** â€” Confgen is meant to handle basic configuration of common tools. However some amount of additional configuration will always be needed. In order to get out of peoples' way, we try to leave existing configuration files intact as much as possible.
 
* **Don't config the configs** â€” Confgen does not provide any API for fine-tuning your configs. The parameters are just a list of presets with minimal per-preset flags. If a config file needs fine-tuned, the associated presets can simply be omitted, and you can configure it yourself. Confgen is not meant to be a universal "configuration configuration" language. See Issue #2.

* **Convention over configuration** â€” Like Rails, Confgen supports composing together many different pieces of functionality from a vast catalog of presets. In order for this to be a tractable problem, we rely on strict conventions for folder structure, the location of configuration files, etc. It will never support arbitrary module structures.

## The Future

I'm still not sure whether confgen is a good idea or a horrible idea.

### Won't happen

- **Won't** become a general-purpose automation tool like Puppet. I think the power here is that it just
  helps with common configuration boilerplate. Anything much beyond adding some keys to a JSON file
  is out of scope.
- **Won't** work with anything other than JavaScript. I want the list of presets to stay relatively
  manageable

### Probably will happen

- [x] Collect up the NPM packages to install them all at once (will be a bit faster)
- [x] Add a mega `yarn all the things` that does the whole build, linting, formatting, type checking, and test which is nice to do before a deploy
- [x] We should probably have some tests!
- [x] ~Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript or https://github.com/ezolenko/rollup-plugin-typescript2 instead of tsc to generate types. Right now, tsc is just generating a .d.ts for every ts file, and these have path aliases and stuff in them that don't work after build. Maybe the rollup plugin will be smarter?~ Edit: Turns out the simplest way to do this is just use [tsc-alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-alias). All that other stuff is insanely complex (ttypescript seems like a real hack).
- [x] Add Apollo Client query type generation
- [x] Add `else exit 1;` to the celebrations
- [x] Lint should not fail on an empty project
- [x] Add githubPkg:scope preset
- [x] Don't add a project, and don't put \*.js in ignorePatterns unless in TypeScript mode
- [ ] Add launch.json for vitest debugging
- [x] Allow global options to come before builds
- [ ] Runs without a package.json
- [ ] Consider removing @typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises override in react code
- [ ] Automatically add parserOptions.project: tsconfig.json when using the react preset
- [x] Add an easy way to do preset arg validation
- [ ] Add eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort
- [ ] Use `"@typescript-eslint/no-duplicate-imports": ["error"]` instead of `"no-duplicate-imports": "off"` in TypeScript mode
- [ ] Do import type { foo } from 'bar' in most places since eslint does that when it autofixes
- [ ] Sort scripts
- [ ] Remove and ban .. in import paths
- [ ] Don't add a demo test file if there already is a .test.ts file
- [ ] Don't add react demo test file if react preset isn't used
- [ ] Add debug:test and debug:start commands
- [ ] Add watch:test, watch:build, watch:generate, and watch commands
- [ ] Include graphql.vscode-graphql extension when... well we don't have an apollo preset anymore, so just when we include codegen?
- [ ] Add `"@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises": ["error"]` and `"parserOptions": { "project": ["./tsconfig.json"] }` as needed
- [ ] Enable `"typescript.tsserver.experimental.enableProjectDiagnostics": true`?
- [ ] Turn post-confgen prettier on again

### Might happen

- Update a section in the README
- Adding an init command that lets you check off which presets you want
- Adding a system notification when commands have finished
- PM2 preset
- Making room for other "ecosystems". E.g. maybe there's a separate Webpack ecosystem preset like:
  `npx cofgen webpack node`.
- While `confgen` doesn't currently bootstrap a working app, it might be close. Maybe in the future running `npx confgen vite react devServer` could fully bootstrap a runnable app.
- Need to be more specific about these devServer/library folders. I don't want to open confgen up to a multi-package kind of situation, but currently we do technically support multiple packages, you could have any combo of: src, devServer, and api folders
- Adding a `pojo` command. Right now the `vite` preset generates a POJO (Plain Old JavaScript Object)
  by concatenating top level blocks of JavaScript, like `{ server: { hmr: { port: 443 } } }`. This
  seems to be working for now. But it means that, unlike with JSON files, you can'd add your own
  config alongside that. The `vite` preset has to generate `vite.config.js` entirely. It would be
  better long term if that object could be merged with the existing JavaScript, so you could have
  commands like:

```js
{
  command: 'pojo',
  path: 'vite.config.js',
  start: 'export default defineConfig(',
  content: {
    test: {
      environment: `"jsdom"`,
    },
    build: {
      lib: {
        entry: `path.resolve(__dirname, "lib/index.ts")`,
      },
    },
  },
},
```
